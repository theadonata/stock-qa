# CLAUDE.md

This is the **QA/testing** repo for the Stock/HPP business-finance project.

## Project status

Test tooling chosen: pytest + httpx for API tests (against `stock-backend`),
Playwright for E2E tests (against the deployed `stock-frontend`). See
`stock-business-analyst/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-stack-architecture-design.md`
for the full design.

## Relationship to sibling repos

This project is split across independent repos, each buildable and
deployable on its own with no shared code or path dependency between them:

- `stock-frontend` — client-side UI
- `stock-backend` — API / business logic / data layer
- `stock-infrastructure` — CI/CD, deployment, IaC
- `stock-qa` (this repo) — test plans, test automation
- `stock-business-analyst` — requirements, specs, source material (incl. the original HPP/business-finance notes)

Tests here target the other repos' deployed/published outputs (API
endpoints, built UI), not their source trees directly, so this repo never
needs to be co-located with them.

## Working here

`.claude/` config (agents, hooks, skills, MCP) is kept identical across all
five repos on purpose, so any agent persona works the same way regardless of
which repo it's invoked in. Once a stack is chosen, update this file with
real test/run commands.

## Git

Do not commit changes in this repo automatically — even when using
atomic-commit or similar workflows. Only commit when the user explicitly
asks for it.

Never push directly to the `main` branch, even when explicitly asked to
"push" or "commit and push" — `main` is protected and requires a pull
request. Always push to a new branch and open a PR instead, across all
five `stock-*` repos.

Always branch off `main` for new work, and sync first: run
`git fetch origin && git merge --ff-only origin/main` (or
`git pull --ff-only`) before creating the branch — cutting a branch from a
stale local `main` produces a PR with a stale diff or spurious merge
conflicts.

## Code style

Always put comments in code so it is understandable by a human reader —
explain what each test verifies and why, not just restate the assertions.

## Environment files

Always use `.env.local` for local config — never create or reintroduce a
`.env.example`/`.env.sample` template file. `.env.local` already exists in
this repo (gitignored) and holds the real placeholder values directly; if a
new env var is needed, add it straight to `.env.local` (with a comment
explaining it) rather than adding a separate example file for someone to
copy from.

MCP servers configured in `.mcp.json` that reference `${VAR_NAME}` (e.g.
the `github` server needs `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`) read from the
process environment, which is not populated automatically. Before using
such an MCP server or making authenticated GitHub calls, read the value
out of this repo's `.env.local` (e.g.
`grep GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN .env.local`) and export it for the
current shell — don't assume it's already set.

## Gitignore

Always ensure a `.gitignore` exists in this repo — never let it be
deleted or skipped when scaffolding. It has two parts:

- A **shared baseline** kept identical (word-for-word) across all five
  `stock-*` repos: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.claude/settings.local.json`. If
  you add an entry to this shared baseline in any one repo, add the same
  line to the other four repos' `.gitignore` files too, so they stay in
  sync.
- **Repo-specific entries** below the baseline (this repo has both a
  Python section — `__pycache__/`, `.venv/` — and a Node/Playwright
  section — `node_modules/`, `test-results/`, `playwright-report/` — since
  it holds two independent test suites) — these are expected to differ
  per repo's tooling and should NOT be copied to siblings.
